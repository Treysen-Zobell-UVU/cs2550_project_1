<h2>Binary Confusion</h2>
<div class="poem">
    Numbers and figures
    Make a lot of sense to me
    But people do not

    Numbers and logic come easy to me, but people don't.

<! -- Brief Essay -->
<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
<p>My first interest is programming. I enjoy learning how to give instructions to the computer in a way that cannot be misunderstood. I like thinking through clever bits of logic that can simplify or solve
a problem using creativity and problem-solving. I enjoy the variety that comes with a job built around thinking your way through problems.</p>
<p>My second interest is archery. It's a peaceful pass-time that gives your shoulders and arms a good workout. You spend a lot of your time learning to relax and hold still while holding back the great weight
of the string.</p>
<p>My third interest is gaming. I get to keep up with my friends in other cities and get to make new friends across the globe with it. The easiest way I know of to expand your cultural awareness is to get to
know people around the world in a casual setting with a shared task.</p>
